### Summary of Work Completed

#### 1. Fixed "Select All" Button on Customer Selection Page
- **Issue**: The select all button on the customer selection page wasn't working properly

  - Forms: Separate forms for creation (`PeriodicCampaignForm`) and editing (`PeriodicCampaignEditForm`)
  - Features: Campaign statistics, execution logs, status toggling (active/paused)

#### 4. Added Test Run Functionality for Periodic Campaigns
- **Purpose**: Allow users to verify periodic campaigns work correctly before full deployment
- **Implementation**:
  - Created `periodic_campaign_test_run` view that sends to up to 5 customers
  - Replaces all template variables including `target_link`
  - Creates full audit trail with `PeriodicCampaignLog` entries
  - Added "Test Run" button to periodic campaign detail page

3. **Namespace Issues**:
