### Completed Tasks (2025-09-04)

1. **Fixed Cart Persistence After Login**
   - **Issue**: Cart items were not being preserved after user login due to Django session key cycling

     - Signal checks multiple locations for anonymous cart (old key, current key, recent carts)
     - Cart items with options are properly merged preserving quantities and prices

### Technical Notes

#### Accounting Module Implementation
- **Double-Entry Bookkeeping**: Every transaction creates balanced journal entries
- **Chart of Accounts**: 
  - 1010: Bank - Checking
  - 1100: Accounts Receivable (not 1200 which is Inventory)
  - 2000: Accounts Payable
  - 4000: Sales Revenue
  - 2200: Sales Tax Payable
- **Automatic Posting**:
  - Sales invoices â†’ DR: A/R (1100), CR: Revenue (4000) + Tax (2200)
  - Purchase orders â†’ DR: Inventory/Expense, CR: A/P (2000)
  - Payments â†’ DR: Bank (1010), CR: A/R (1100)
  - All automated entries are created with `posted=True` (not drafts)
- **Journal Entry Approval**:
  - Individual approval/unapproval with balance validation
  - Entries must be balanced (total debits = total credits) to be approved
  - Filter by status: All, Posted, Draft
- **Idempotent Posting**: 
  - Multiple calls with same document create only one journal entry
  - Existing entries are returned without duplication
- **Access URLs**:
  - Dashboard: `/home/accounting/`
  - General Ledger: `/home/accounting/general-ledger/`
  - Trial Balance: `/home/accounting/trial-balance/`
  - Income Statement: `/home/accounting/income-statement/`
  - Balance Sheet: `/home/accounting/balance-sheet/`
  - Post Documents: `/home/accounting/post-documents/`

#### Purchase Order 3-Step Process Implementation
- Views: `PurchaseOrderCreateStep1View`, `PurchaseOrderCreateStep2View`, `PurchaseOrderCreateStep3View`
- Edit Views: `PurchaseOrderEditStep1View`, `PurchaseOrderEditStep2View`, `PurchaseOrderEditStep3View`
- Uses Django sessions to maintain state between steps
- URLs: `/purchases/orders/create/step1/`, `/step2/`, `/step3/` (same pattern for edit)
- Purchase Order Create's 1st step should have the supplier list, not select box, like the invoice create's 1st page.


#### Type Safety Fix for Purchase Orders
- Issue: `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'float' and 'decimal.Decimal'`
- Solution: Store numeric values as strings in session, convert to Decimal when creating/updating items
- Updated `PurchaseOrderItem.save()` to handle type conversion explicitly

#### Inventory Creation
- Accessible from purchase order detail when item is serial number managed
- Modal-based UI for entering multiple serial numbers
- Creates individual inventory records for each serial number
- Links inventory to purchase order via `purchase_order_number` field

### Known Issues/Notes
- python-dateutil not installed (warranty calculations commented out)
- All numeric fields in purchase orders use Decimal type for precision
- Supplier model is now normalized with separate contact management
- Category model supports unlimited hierarchy depth
- Inventory list view supports filtering by purchase_order parameter

### Next Steps
- Install python-dateutil and uncomment warranty calculation code
- Continue Tailwind CSS conversion for Blog and Campaign modules
- Consider adding bulk operations for inventory management
- Add category breadcrumb navigation in product views
- Implement category-based product filtering

### Creating inventory
- Process
   1. Create a purchase order
   2. Add a product as a item of the purchase.
   3. Save a purchase order.
   4. if the product is managed by the serial number - check 'is_serial_number_cheched' field, there is a inventory creating button.
   5. if the user click the inventory creation button. the inventory creation modal window opens.
   6. the inventory creation modal window has a serial number input box which multiple serial numbers allowed by comma. 
   7. When saving the inventory, the inventory will be created in the Inventory model.
   

### Customer Creation on User Registration
   1. When a user signs up, a Customer record is automatically created
   2. Implementation approach:
      - Use Django signals (post_save) on User model
      - Create Customer with basic info from User (email, first_name, last_name)
      - Link Customer to User with OneToOneField
   3. In the Profile page, there should be the customer information update form
      - Allow users to update their customer details (phone, company, address, etc.)
      - customer_portal.views.profile_view already handles this
   4. Access pattern:
      - Use `request.user.customer` to access customer from user
      - Handle cases where customer might not exist (create on demand) 

### Factory Management System (Added: 2025-01-09)

#### Overview
Comprehensive supply chain management system for handling order fulfillment and shipping.

#### Key Components:

1. **WorkOrder Model**
   - Tracks fulfillment of invoice items
   - Priority levels: Low, Normal, High, Urgent
   - Status: Pending â†’ In Progress â†’ Ready â†’ Shipped â†’ Completed
   - Progress tracking with percentage calculation
   - Department/user assignment

2. **FulfillmentItem Model**
   - Individual item tracking within work orders
   - Inventory allocation management
   - Quantity tracking (ordered/allocated/fulfilled)
   - Warehouse location tracking
   - Quality check support

3. **Shipment Model**
   - Multi-carrier support (UPS, FedEx, USPS, DHL, etc.)
   - Tracking number management
   - Auto-populates shipping address from invoice
   - Package details (weight, dimensions)
   - Cost tracking (shipping + insurance)
   - Document generation flags

4. **SupplyRequest Model**
   - Supply request workflow
   - Approval system
   - Urgency levels
   - Links to purchase orders

#### Workflow:
1. Invoice created â†’ Work Order generated
2. Inventory allocated to items
3. Items fulfilled after quality check
4. Shipment created with tracking
5. Delivery confirmation

#### Admin Features:
- Visual progress bars for work orders
- Inline editing of fulfillment items
- Quick actions for status updates
- Automatic number generation (WO-XXXXXX, SHIP-XXXXXX, SR-XXXXXX)

#### Usage:
- Admin Access: `/admin/factory/`
- Factory Portal: `/factory/` (for factory users)
- Create work orders from invoices
- Allocate inventory to fulfill orders
- Create and track shipments
- Manage supply requests

### Factory Portal System

#### Overview:
Factory users (linked to suppliers) have their own portal to manage work orders and shipments.

#### FactoryUser Model:
- Linked to Django User and Supplier
- Roles: manager, supervisor, worker, quality, shipping
- Permissions for different operations
- Employee ID and department tracking

#### Factory Portal Features (`/factory/`):
- **Dashboard**: Statistics, recent orders, pending supplies
- **Work Orders**: View and manage supplier-specific orders
- **Shipments**: Create and track shipments
- **Supply Requests**: Monitor and approve supply needs
- **Profile**: Manage factory user profile

#### Access Control:
- Factory users only see work orders for their supplier's products
- Role-based permissions for updating orders and creating shipments
- Managers/supervisors can approve orders and supply requests

#### Creating Factory Users:
1. Create a regular Django user account
2. Create FactoryUser record in admin linking to user and supplier
3. Set appropriate role and permissions
4. User can then login and access `/factory/` portal
